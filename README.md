Employee Salary Prediction using Machine Learning
This project aims to predict employee salaries based on features like age, gender, education level, job title, and years of experience. It was developed as part of the Edunet Internship Capstone Project.

Problem Statement
To develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts the salary of an employee based on various input features. The goal is to help organizations analyze compensation benchmarks and support fair salary decisions.

Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:
Age
Gender
Education Leve
Job Title
Years of Experience
Salary (Target
Model Used
Random Forest Regressor (chosen after testing multiple models)

Evaluation Metrics
Mean Squared Error (MSE): ~144,275,509
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): ~12,011
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): ~8,516
R² Score: ~0.94

Output
See the graph generated by the model:
salary_prediction_plot.png shows the comparison between actual and predicted salaries.

Conclusion
The Random Forest model provided high prediction accuracy with an R² score of 0.94. It effectively captures the relationship between employee attributes and salary. The model can be enhanced with additional features or more diverse data in the future.
